## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on three things.
The first one is to work with GIT as version control. Continue to learn the basics and how to use GIT in the development process.
Secondly, try to split the CSS code with SCSS to make it more manageable. This approach can be more useful in larger projects.
As the last thing, I tried to use Figma for the first time as the design tool for the specification.
